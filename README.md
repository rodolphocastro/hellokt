# HelloKT

This repository is a simple playground for Kotlin features and libraries.

## Building and Testing

Simply do a `gradlew test`, this is everything this project needs to be "executed".

## Project structure

The `main` subdirectory contains a dummy Console app that simply prints something.

The `test` subdirectory contains all the tests that describe the steps taken on playing with this language and its libraries.
